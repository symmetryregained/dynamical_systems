## 1. Lotka-Volterra system
  Lotka-Volterra system is also known as Predator-Prey population dynamics.
  
 ### Mathematica version
  The Lotka-Volterra.nb script allows working with arbitrary number of populations and custom definition of interaction terms, i.e. it can adopt a generalized n-dimensional Lotka-Volterra population dynamics analysis. One can interactively play with visual representation of the state space and the evolution of the system's trajectory in time.
